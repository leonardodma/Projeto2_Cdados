    "# Introdução \n",
    "A pandemia do corona vírus fez com que o futebol parasse, inclusive o campeonato inglês (Premiere League). Existem campeonatos que foram interrompidos, como o campeonato francês, mesmo sem ter finalizado todos os jogos e também há campeonatos que retonaram porém com desempenhos diferentes de cada equipe. Isso fez com que surgisse o seguinte questionamento: o que provavelmente ocorreria com o campeonato inglês se a pandemia não tivesse a interrompido?"
